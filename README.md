# Red Ledger

Local-first desktop chat for working with LLMs and your files.

No accounts, no cloud sync, no telemetry. Settings and chat data stay on your machine.

## What It Does

- Multi-provider chat with streaming: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, and LM Studio.
- Tool calling for local file ops + web/wiki/url tools.
- Workspace jail for file safety, with optional strict confirmation mode.
- 3 persistent context files (`system`, `user`, `org`) injected into every run.
- File attachments from `.txt`, `.md`, and `.pdf` (PDF text extraction included).
- Local SQLite conversation history with retry/copy message actions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- Optional local runtimes:
  - Ollama (`http://localhost:11434`)
  - LM Studio (`http://localhost:1234`)

### Install + Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/domwxyz/red-ledger.git
cd red-ledger
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Native Rebuild (if needed)

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start Electron + Vite dev mode |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |
| `npm run rebuild` | Rebuild `better-sqlite3` for Electron |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript checks |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run test` | Run tests once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |

## Provider Notes

- OpenAI and OpenRouter use OpenAI-style APIs.
- Ollama uses local Ollama endpoints.
- LM Studio supports both:
  - OpenAI-compatible endpoints
  - Native LM Studio endpoints

LM Studio compatibility mode is set in the app Settings panel.

## Data + Storage

- Settings: `settings.json`
- Conversations/messages: `conversations.db` (SQLite, WAL)
- Message attachments are stored as structured data (`Attachment[]`) in the DB.
- Messages are listed in chronological order (`created_at ASC`).

## Tool System

The LLM can invoke these tools during a conversation:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file` | Read a file from the workspace |
| `write_file` | Write or overwrite a workspace file |
| `append_file` | Append content to a workspace file |
| `list_files` | List the workspace directory tree |
| `web_search` | Search the web (Tavily or SerpAPI) |
| `wiki_search` | Search Wikipedia for article summaries |
| `fetch_url` | Fetch and parse a full webpage by URL (includes extracted `links` for navigation) |

Tools self-register via the tool registry. Strict mode shows a native confirmation dialog before each operation. Tool errors are caught and returned in the result so the LLM can self-correct without crashing the stream.

## Packaging

```bash
npx electron-builder --win
npx electron-builder --mac
npx electron-builder --linux
```

## Portable Mode

Place a `settings.json` file in the `resources/` directory next to the executable. When detected, Red Ledger stores settings and the SQLite database alongside the binary instead of in the OS user data path. Useful for USB deployments.
